            <h3>New player tips for Genshin</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Save up 16 wishes and use the new player wish to get at least 2 free, non-story characters. Very helpful early on.</li>
                <li>Focus on getting to Adventurer Rank (AR) 16 by doing the story and side quests. This unlocks co-op, as well as most of the content in the game.</li>
                <li>USE YOUR <a href="https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Original_Resin">RESIN</a> WISELY.
                    <ul>
                        <li> Pre AR 35, just farm world bosses for character ascension materials. DO NOT do <a href="https://attackofthefanboy.com/guides/genshin-impact-what-are-ley-lines-how-to-complete-ley-lines/">ley lines</a> or <a href="https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Domains">domains</a>.</li>
                        <li> Once you reach AR 35, now start to farm the EXP ley line to stock up on character experience materials (Hero's Wit)</li>
                        <li> Upon reaching AR 45, you may do max rank domains for the best artifact drops. HOWEVER, they will be challenging at AR 45.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>If you can spare the money, buy the Battle Pass. For $10, you earn a TON of materials at a time. Very worth it.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>***This list may be update if I should think of other tips or if anyone else has anything they would recommend I add to it.</p>

              <h3>Tasks</h3>
              <p>Now you are not required to do these tasks but they are recomended to maintain a good amount of resources and not wasting rechargeable ones (like resin).</p>
